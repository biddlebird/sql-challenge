# sql-challenge
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I researched employee data from the 1980s and 1990s using six CSV files. I created an ERD, designed table schemas, and imported the CSV data into a SQL database. Then, I performed various queries to analyze the data.

# Data Analysis Assignment

## Overview

This assignment involves writing SQL queries to perform various data analysis tasks on an employee database. The goal is to extract specific information about employees, such as their names, hire dates, departments, and salaries. The queries will be used to retrieve the required data and generate reports.

## Tasks

Below are the tasks that need to be completed along with a brief description of what each task entails.

### 1. List the Employee Number, Last Name, First Name, Sex, and Salary of Each Employee
- **Objective:** Retrieve basic employee details including their salary.
- **Required Tables:** `Employees`, `Salaries`
- **Query:** Write a query that joins the `Employees` table with the `Salaries` table based on the employee number.

### 2. List the First Name, Last Name, and Hire Date for the Employees Who Were Hired in 1986
- **Objective:** Retrieve details of employees who were hired in the year 1986.
- **Required Table:** `Employees`
- **Query:** Filter the `Employees` table based on the `hire_date` column to include only those records from 1986.

### 3. List the Manager of Each Department Along with Their Department Number, Department Name, Employee Number, Last Name, and First Name
- **Objective:** Identify the managers of each department and list their details along with the department information.
- **Required Tables:** `Departments`, `Dept_Managers`, `Employees`
- **Query:** Join the `Departments`, `Dept_Managers`, and `Employees` tables to match department managers with their respective departments.

### 4. List the Department Number for Each Employee Along with That Employeeâ€™s Employee Number, Last Name, First Name, and Department Name
- **Objective:** Retrieve department and employee details for each employee.
- **Required Tables:** `Departments`, `Dept_Employees`, `Employees`
- **Query:** Join the `Departments`, `Dept_Employees`, and `Employees` tables to list employees along with their department details.

### 5. List First Name, Last Name, and Sex of Each Employee Whose First Name Is Hercules and Whose Last Name Begins with the Letter B
- **Objective:** Find specific employees with the first name "Hercules" and last names starting with "B".
- **Required Table:** `Employees`
- **Query:** Filter the `Employees` table based on the `first_name` and `last_name` columns.

### 6. List Each Employee in the Sales Department, Including Their Employee Number, Last Name, and First Name
- **Objective:** Identify all employees who work in the Sales department.
- **Required Tables:** `Employees`, `Departments`, `Dept_Employees`
- **Query:** Join the necessary tables to retrieve employees who are part of the Sales department.

### 7. List Each Employee in the Sales and Development Departments, Including Their Employee Number, Last Name, First Name, and Department Name
- **Objective:** Retrieve details of employees who work in either the Sales or Development departments.
- **Required Tables:** `Employees`, `Departments`, `Dept_Employees`
- **Query:** Filter the joined tables to include employees in the Sales and Development departments.

### 8. List the Frequency Counts, in Descending Order, of All the Employee Last Names
- **Objective:** Determine how many employees share each last name and sort the results in descending order of frequency.
- **Required Table:** `Employees`
- **Query:** Use a `GROUP BY` clause on the `last_name` column and sort the result by the count of last names.

## How to Run the Queries

1. **Set Up the Database:** Ensure you have access to a SQL environment where the database schema is set up with the required tables (`Employees`, `Salaries`, `Departments`, `Dept_Managers`, `Dept_Employees`).

2. **Execute the Queries:** Run each SQL query sequentially to retrieve the required data for each task.

3. **Review the Results:** The results should provide the necessary data as described in each task. If any adjustments are needed based on the results, modify the queries accordingly.

## Conclusion

This assignment involves applying SQL skills to extract and analyze employee data from a database. The tasks are designed to practice joining tables, filtering data, and performing aggregations. Successful completion of these tasks will demonstrate proficiency in SQL and the ability to handle real-world data analysis scenarios.
