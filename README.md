# SQL-challenge
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I researched employee data from the 1980s and 1990s using six CSV files. I created an ERD, designed table schemas, and imported the CSV data into a SQL database. Then, I performed various queries to analyze the data.

# Creating an ERD with QuickDBD
Building a QuickDBD (Quick Database Diagram) is essential for effectively visualizing a database schema, which significantly enhances understanding by providing a clear view of table structures, relationships, and key constraints. It improves communication with stakeholders by offering a straightforward representation of data models, aiding in design and planning by facilitating rapid adjustments and identifying potential issues early. QuickDBD simplifies troubleshooting by quickly revealing design problems and serves as valuable documentation for future reference. Additionally, it supports design validation, ensuring all requirements are met, and boosts development efficiency by allowing developers to implement and query the database with a better grasp of its structure.

# Design Table Schemas

In pgAdmin 4, you can import a CSV file into a table by following these steps:

1. **Open pgAdmin 4** and connect to your PostgreSQL database.
2. **Navigate to the Table**: In the Object browser, expand your database, schema, and then the "Tables" node to find the table you want to import the CSV data into.
3. **Right-Click on the Table**: Right-click on the table into which you want to import data.
4. **Select "Import/Export Data"**: From the context menu, choose the "Import/Export Data" option.
5. **Configure Import Settings**:
   - **File Format**: Set the format to "CSV".
   - **File Path**: Browse and select your CSV file.
   - **Options**: Adjust delimiter, quote, and other CSV-specific options as needed.
6. **Start the Import**: Click the "OK" or "Import" button to begin importing the data.

The CSV file will be read and its contents will be imported into the selected table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_no VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Departments PRIMARY KEY (dept_no)
);

CREATE TABLE Titles (
    title_id VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Titles PRIMARY KEY (title_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    emp_title_id VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    sex CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Employees PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
);

CREATE TABLE Dept_Employees (
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    dept_no VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Dept_Employees PRIMARY KEY (emp_no, dept_no)
);

CREATE TABLE Salaries (
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    salary INT NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Salaries PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
);

CREATE TABLE Dept_Managers (
    dept_no VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    emp_no INT NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT pk_Dept_Managers PRIMARY KEY (emp_no, dept_no)
);
```
## Tasks

Below are the tasks that need to be completed along with a brief description of what each task entails.

## How to Run the Queries

1. **Set Up the Database:** Ensure you have access to a SQL environment where the database schema is set up with the required tables (`Employees`, `Salaries`, `Departments`, `Dept_Managers`, `Dept_Employees`).

2. **Execute the Queries:** Run each SQL query sequentially to retrieve the required data for each task.

3. **Review the Results:** The results should provide the necessary data as described in each task. If any adjustments are needed based on the results, modify the queries accordingly.

## Conclusion

This assignment involves applying SQL skills to extract and analyze employee data from a database. The tasks are designed to practice joining tables, filtering data, and performing aggregations. Successful completion of these tasks will demonstrate proficiency in SQL and the ability to handle real-world data analysis scenarios.
